Final version of the game

YOu are to use WASD to run from the enemy on the screen and left click with the mouse to shoot, the enemy starts with 20 health and every 5 waves you complete a screen will pop up telling you his health has increased. You do not regain health but you move faster than the enemy so you can get away. See how far you can make it!

Controls: The WASD keys are used to move left, right, up, and down, as well asleft click on the mouse to shoot.
